# Decompiling Project Zomboid
Example repository demonstrating how to decompile the Project Zomboid source for use in mod development.

This example is entirely based on the (excellent) [documentation by konjima](https://github.com/Konijima/PZ-Libraries) on
how to structure a IntelliJ IDEA project, configure Gradle, and run the decompiler. As someone who struggled with
using some of the tooling initially, I can't express my appreciation for this documentation enough.


## Getting Started
Run configurations are already generated. Run the `setupWorkspace` Gradle task to get started.

See the [Decompiling section](https://github.com/Konijima/PZ-Libraries#c-decompiling) of the documentation.
